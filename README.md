# 🍔 Burger Bot - An Interactive Chatbot for Burger Orders

Welcome to the Burger Bot project! This chatbot is designed to assist customers in placing their burger orders at Burger Singh Restaurant. It uses Google Generative AI for prompt engineering and Gradio for creating an interactive user interface.

## 🛠️ Project Overview

In this project, I've developed a chatbot that:
- Greets customers and takes their burger orders.
- Asks if the order is for pickup or delivery.
- Provides menu options, including burgers, fries, toppings, and drinks.
- Summarizes the order and checks if the customer wants to add anything else.
- Collects payment details.
